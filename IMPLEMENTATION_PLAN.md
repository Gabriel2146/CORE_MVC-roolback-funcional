# Implementation Plan for Core MVC Training Project

## Overview
This document outlines the detailed implementation plan to fully realize the functionalities described for the Core MVC Training Project, covering backend and frontend development, roles, views, and features.

---

## 1. Backend Implementation

### 1.1 Models
- Extend existing models to include:
  - Fatigue, compatibility, variation, progression metrics for adaptive optimization.
  - Detailed session and exercise metrics (e.g., perceived effort, rest time).
  - Feedback models linked to sessions and exercises.

### 1.2 Serializers
- Create serializers for new models and extend existing ones with validation logic.

### 1.3 Views / API Endpoints
- Implement endpoints for:
  - Adaptive training plan generation and optimization.
  - Metrics recording and querying.
  - Feedback submission and retrieval.
  - Progress analysis and deviation detection.
  - User management and role-based access control.
  - Exercise catalog management (including wger integration).

### 1.4 Services / Business Logic
- Develop algorithms for:
  - Realistic effectiveness index calculation.
  - Adaptive optimization of exercise selection and session distribution.
  - Dynamic adjustment based on feedback and progress.

### 1.5 Admin Interface
- Complete admin registrations for all models.
- Add filters, search, and list displays for efficient management.

### 1.6 Security
- Enforce permissions and authentication.
- Harden API endpoints.

## 2. Frontend Implementation

### 2.1 Views / Components
- Athlete dashboard with:
  - Training plan overview.
  - Session tracking and metric input forms.
  - Progress analysis charts.
- Trainer dashboard with:
  - Athlete management.
  - Plan creation and adjustment interfaces.
  - Feedback review.
- Admin dashboard with:
  - User and exercise catalog management.
  - Reports and monitoring.
- Shared components:
  - Login, Register, Logout.
  - Navigation and routing.
  - Error and validation handling.

### 2.2 State Management and API Integration
- Use Vuex or Composition API for state.
- Integrate with backend APIs for data fetching and submission.

### 2.3 Validations and UX
- Robust form validations.
- Loading states and error messages.
- Responsive design considerations.

## 3. Testing

### 3.1 Backend
- Unit tests for models, serializers, services.
- Integration tests for API endpoints.

### 3.2 Frontend
- Unit tests for components.
- End-to-end tests for user flows.

---

## 4. Deployment and Documentation

- Prepare production settings.
- Create deployment scripts or instructions.
- Complete technical and user documentation.

---

## Next Steps

- Begin backend model and API development.
- Parallel frontend component scaffolding.
- Iterative testing and integration.
